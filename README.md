# BlockNote-demo-nextjs-hocuspocus

This is a demo of BlockNote with Next.js, HocusPocus with comments and thread storage handled via a REST API (built using Hono).

## Setup

The two projects are in the `hocuspocus-server` and `next-app` folders.
(we didn't set up a monorepo for this demo).

Run `npm install` in both folders.

To run the server, run `npm run dev` in the `hocuspocus-server` folder.

To run the next app, run `npm run dev` in the `next-app` folder.
